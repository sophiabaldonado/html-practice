      <h2>The History of Muju Juju and Cosplay</h2>
      <p>
        From the very first day Muju Juju was thought of it was always apparent that there would need to be some hardcore Muju cosplay. The original idea was that we would all cosplay as Muju for GDC. We even announced it on <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, so you know we were srs.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Muju cosplay at #GDC is gonna happen. - <a href="https://twitter.com/mujucru">@MujuCru</a>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        But so far it's been two GDCs and still there have been no Muju cosplays at GDC. This is problematic. Last year we didn't go to GDC but this year one of us went but didn't cosplay as Muju. Blasphemy.

        So, I decided to make a Muju beard so there are no excuses about cosplaying as Muju from here on out.

      <h2>How to Make a Muju Beard</h2>
      <p>
        I will explain the exact process for creating the beard. First you need to get all the beard making supplies, though.
      </p>
      <details>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Wool
          </li>
          <li>
            String
          </li>
          <li>
            Hot glue gun
          </li>
          <li>
            Magical juju
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      You'll also want to write some code about Muju because he's so inspiring that we made a game about him. Here is an example of the different robe selections you have in the game.
      <pre>
        <code>
          for _, slot in pairs({'robebottom', 'torso', 'front_upper_arm', 'rear_upper_arm', 'front_bracer', 'rear_bracer'}) do
            local slot = animation.spine.skeleton:findSlot(slot)
            slot.r, slot.g, slot.b = unpack(config.player.colors[color])
          end
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        You can use these game colors as a starting point for when you start to think about what color robe you want to make.
      </p>
      <p>Also, you should start at <time>2:00</time>a then take a break at <time>3:20</time>a to go walk duju.</p>
      <p>
        If you really need <em>moar</em> inspiration then here's a spuju to scare you into doing it.
